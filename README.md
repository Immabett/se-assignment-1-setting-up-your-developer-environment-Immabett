# Dev_Setup
Setup Development Environment

#Assignment: Setting Up Your Developer Environment

#Objective:
This assignment aims to familiarize you with the tools and configurations necessary to set up an efficient developer environment for software engineering projects. Completing this assignment will give you the skills required to set up a robust and productive workspace conducive to coding, debugging, version control, and collaboration.

#Tasks:

1. Select Your Operating System (OS):
   Choose an operating system that best suits your preferences and project requirements. Download and Install Windows 11. https://www.microsoft.com/software-download/windows11

2. Install a Text Editor or Integrated Development Environment (IDE):
   Select and install a text editor or IDE suitable for your programming languages and workflow. Download and Install Visual Studio Code. https://code.visualstudio.com/Download
3. Set Up Version Control System:
   Install Git and configure it on your local machine. Create a GitHub account for hosting your repositories. Initialize a Git repository for your project and make your first commit. https://github.com

4. Install Necessary Programming Languages and Runtimes:
  Instal Python from http://wwww.python.org programming language required for your project and install their respective compilers, interpreters, or runtimes. Ensure you have the necessary tools to build and execute your code.

5. Install Package Managers:
   If applicable, install package managers like pip (Python).

6. Configure a Database (MySQL):
   Download and install MySQL database. https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/windows/installer/5.7.html

7. Set Up Development Environments and Virtualization (Optional):
   Consider using virtualization tools like Docker or virtual machines to isolate project dependencies and ensure consistent environments across different machines.

8. Explore Extensions and Plugins:
   Explore available extensions, plugins, and add-ons for your chosen text editor or IDE to enhance functionality, such as syntax highlighting, linting, code formatting, and version control integration.

9. Document Your Setup:
    Create a comprehensive document outlining the steps you've taken to set up your developer environment. Include any configurations, customizations, or troubleshooting steps encountered during the process. 

#Deliverables:
- Document detailing the setup process with step-by-step instructions and screenshots where necessary.
- A GitHub repository containing a sample project initialized with Git and any necessary configuration files (e.g., .gitignore).
- A reflection on the challenges faced during setup and strategies employed to overcome them.
ANSWERS TO ASSIGNMENT
Development Environment Setup
Introduction
This document outlines the steps taken to set up a development environment suitable for software engineering projects. It includes the installation and configuration of necessary tools and software, along with a summary of challenges faced and solutions attempted.

Installed Software and Tools
Operating System:

Windows 11: Installed from Windows 11 Download.
Text Editor/IDE:

Visual Studio Code: Installed from Visual Studio Code Download.
Extensions Installed:
Prettier
Live Server
Python
Pylance
Python Debugger
Version Control System:

Git: Installed from Git Download.
GitHub: Created an account and configured it for hosting repositories.
Programming Languages and Runtimes:

Python: Installed from Python Download.
Verified installation with: code python --version

Dart and Flutter: Installed following official instructions.
Database:
MySQL: Installed from MySQL Installer.
MySQL Workbench: Installed but encountered some issues.
sucessfully installed mysql server mysql workbench and mysql shell
Detailed Setup Process
Installing Windows 11
Downloaded the Windows 11 installation media from the official Microsoft website.
Followed the installation instructions to install Windows 11.

Installing Visual Studio Code
Downloaded Visual Studio Code from the official website.
Installed Visual Studio Code and added necessary extensions:
Prettier
Live Server
Python
Pylance
Python Debugger

Setting Up Version Control System
Downloaded and installed Git.
Configured Git with my username and email:
code
git config --global user.name "my Name"
git config --global user.email "my.email@example.com"
Created a GitHub account and initialized a repository.
Installing Python
Downloaded Python from the official website.
Installed Python and ensured it was added to the system PATH.
Verified the installation:code python --version

Installing Dart and Flutter
Followed the installation instructions from the official Flutter website.
Encountered permission issues when checking versions:
Error message: "permission denied by Trend Micro Apex One"
Tried whitelisting Dart and Flutter executables in Trend Micro Apex One but the issue persisted.

Challenges Faced
Dart and Flutter Permission Issues
Problem: Permission denied by Trend Micro Apex One when running dart --version and flutter --version.
Attempted Solutions:
Whitelisted Dart and Flutter executables in Trend Micro Apex One.
Ran Git Bash as administrator.
Verified file permissions.
Disabled Trend Micro Apex One temporarily to test commands.
Current Status: Still encountering issues but actively troubleshooting

Reflection
Setting up the development environment was a comprehensive task that required attention to detail and troubleshooting skills. The primary challenges were related to permission issues with Dart and Flutter, and configuration issues with MySQL Workbench. Despite these challenges, the process was a valuable learning experience in managing and configuring development tools. Future improvements could include a more detailed review of antivirus settings and a deeper understanding of MySQL configurations.
